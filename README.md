I'VE TRAINED MODEL USING **LINEAR REGRESSION, DECISION TREES, RANDOM FOREST, SVM and KNN**.<br>
I've found out that **KNN** classifies the best as it had better accuracy and predicted almost the same.<br>
I've calculated **training, testing, validation accuracies** for all classifiers.<br>
Then made a table to compare the estimated values and acutal values for each classifier.<br>
Have also plotted graphs between estimated and actual values <br>
