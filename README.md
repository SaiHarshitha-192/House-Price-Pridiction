# House-Price-Pridiction
* I'VE TRAINED MODEL USING **LINEAR REGRESSION, DECISION TREES, RANDOM FOREST, SVM and KNN**.<br>
* I've found out that **KNN** classifies the best as it had better accuracy and predicted almost the same.<br>
* I've calculated **training, testing, validation accuracies** for all classifiers.<br>
* Then made a table to compare the estimated values and acutal values for each classifier.<br>
* Have also plotted graphs between estimated and actual values <br>

# Process:
1. Imported libraries
2. Data exploration and Data cleaning
3. Data visualization
4. Correlation between features
5. Splitting the data
6. Training the model using: 
> 1. Linear regression
> 2. Decision Tree
> 3. Random forest
> 4. SVM
> 5. KNN

# Comparision
